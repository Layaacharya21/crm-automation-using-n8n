# Real Estate CRM Automation using n8n

This project demonstrates an end-to-end automation workflow built using n8n to streamline lead management, employee tracking, and client communication for a real estate business.

## Business Problem
The client struggled with manual lead tracking, delayed follow-ups, and limited visibility into employee work progress and client stages.

## Solution
I designed an automated workflow that:
- Captures leads automatically
- Assigns leads to employees
- Tracks client stages in a structured pipeline
- Sends WhatsApp notifications for new leads and follow-ups
- Provides real-time visibility into business operations


## Key Automations
- Webhook-based lead capture
- WhatsApp notification automation
- Lead stage tracking
- Employee activity monitoring

## Tools Used
- n8n
- Webhooks
- WhatsApp API
- Google Sheets / CRM backend
